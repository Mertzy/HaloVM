# Description: This program, when activated, creates an instance of a game from
#the Halo game series. Various parameters are required in order for this VM to
#work correctly (i.e. beginning weapons, items, and players, etc). Default 
#settings for each instance item is defined in each file for the corresponding
#item. Doccumentation is included in each file and all methods should be well 
#documented, but on the off chance that it is not, a README will be included with
#this project to help clear up any questions. For more info go to http://www.resultheap.com
